Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      As a web developer, I craft the digital landscapes of the internet.
       I design and create websites, ensuring they are not just visually appealing, 
       but also functional and user-friendly. My role involves writing code in various programming languages,
        such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to bring web pages to life. 
        I solve technical challenges, optimize performance, 
        and collaborate with designers and clients to bring their visions to reality. 
        In a constantly evolving digital world, I stay up-to-date with the latest trends
         and technologies to deliver dynamic and engaging online experiences.
          Whether it's building e-commerce platforms, blogs, or interactive web applications,
           my work is pivotal in shaping the online presence of businesses and individuals.
